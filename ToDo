Pawn to anything at y = 0 / y = 7   Done?
    -> after promotion, all pieces dissapear from the _piecesPosition dictionary. wtf!!!

put in the check effect done kinda

put in winning condition
    -> lets have more fun than with Pawn to anything ^^

change from 2 storage systems to 1

king cant move 2 when under attack
check why I can move pieces so that the king is then under attack

put in IsKingUnderAttack in baseWihte and baseBlack, but before collider get destroyed

I should rewrite BaseBlack and BaseWhite, just because its a shit fest
